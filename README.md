# Med-Noise-Cleanse
The Medical Image Denoising using Denoising Autoencoders in TensorFlow and Hexagonal Architecture project enhances medical image quality by removing noise using a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) built with TensorFlow. Designed using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports &amp; Adapters), it ensures modularity, scalability, and flexibility.
